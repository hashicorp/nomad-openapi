# Overview

This package contains 2 high level elements of note.

- `openapi.yaml` - This is the [OpenAPI specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification)
file generated by the `generator` package in this repository. From this
specification, clients and servers can be generated for the Nomad HTTP API. This
file is generated and _should never be edited by hand_.
- This directory contains _hand-written_ go code and associated tests
that provide a higher level of abstraction over the generated client. For example,
the `jobs.go` file contains methods that expose all the jobs related endpoints, and
`jobs_tests.go` contains code showing how a calling client might consume those methods.
The `api.go` file contains framework level code related to creating a client instance,
generating contexts for query and write operations, as well as helper methods for
applying query and write options to requests.

**Note:** This package is experimental and is likely to change. There is no guarantee
of backward compatability, at this time. Method names, signatures, and type names
may change as we iterate.

## Quick start

Import this package to your project.

```shell
go get https://github.com/flytocolors/nomad-openapi
```

Add an import for the package to your code.

```go
import (
	"github.com/flytocolors/nomad-openapi/v1"
)
```

Create a client instance.

```go
client, err := NewClient()
```

All operations are modeled as either queries or writes. Queries require `QueryOpts`
and writes require `WriteOpts`.

```go
var queryOpts = &QueryOpts{}

queryOpts := queryOpts().
    WithRegion("global")
    WithNamespace("default").
    WithAllowStale(true).
    WithWaitIndex(1000).
    WithWaitTime(100000 * time.Millisecond) // WaitTime is expected to always be defined in milliseconds
    // See QueryOpts struct for all possible QueryOpts.
```

These options can then be converted to a context, and passed to each API endpoint
as the first argument.

```go
result, meta, err := client.Jobs().GetJobs(queryOpts.Ctx())
if err != nil {
	// do error handling
}
```

- Most endpoint functions returns a result, a meta struct, and an error
- All endpoint functions return an `error`
- If the error is not `nil`, both result and meta should be `nil` and no further
evaluation is necessary
- The result will usually be a model from the generated `client` package, but may also be a golang primitive type like
`string` or `int`
- The meta struct contains metadata about the state of the server at the time of
the response as callers may wish to track things like the last index at the time
of the operation
- See the `QueryMeta` and `WriteMeta` structs for a full explanation of the metadata
returned for query and write operations respectively

## Goals

This package has several goals which are listed below.

- Create an opinionated, consistent API DX across all endpoints of the Nomad HTTP API
- Provide a high-level abstraction over the generated client
- Provide an example of how to consume a generated OpenAPI client
- Experiment with `context` as a first-class citizen of the Nomad API
- Experiment with API versioning and uplift mechanisms
- Experiment with a unified OpenAPI/AsyncAPI client
